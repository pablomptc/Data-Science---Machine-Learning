This is the code used from the beggining until the final of the prediction. I have tried to explain every step in the code in order to help 
other people to understand the process.

**DESCRIPTIVE AND PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF BOSTON HOUSING DATASET**


I start from the housing dataset. This is a dataset that contains information about houses in suburban Boston in 1978. Before I already did this same analysis with other private datasets of companies, but I am going to apply it to a public dataset for obvious privacy issues.

**DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS**
The dataset will be loaded and the objective in this section will be to explore de data through groupings, correlations and other statistical measures.

**PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS**
A multiple lineal regression model will be apply to the data.
